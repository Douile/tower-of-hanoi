# Towers of Hanoi

_A simple html5 canvas+js towers of hanoi game._

[Play on github pages](https://douile.github.io/tower-of-hanoi/)

## Notes

+ Auto play will freeze for large amount of rings due to nature of current algorithm
+ Cannot continue playing auto play after pausing
+ Unable to change tower count right now
+ Will not work on IE11

### Things I hope to add soon

+ Better auto algorithm
+ Change tower count
+ Move counter / Min possible moves
